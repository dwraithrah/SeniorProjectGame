# SeniorProjectGame
This game was created during my final semester at the University of Houston-Downtown. It was created to work in conjunction with a data
gathering experiment. The player would wear an Empatica wrist device (similar to a watch) that gathered various bio-rhythmic readings from 
the player.  The game was designed to either be really easy or get frustratingly hard so I could take the readings and see if there was 
an obvious pattern that could potentially be used for future experiments. 

The game itself spawns two enemy types, a runner and a warrior, whose goal is to get behind the player and destroy a wall the player is
guarding. If the wall is destroyed, it's game over. If the player is killed, it's game over.  The runner is faster than the warrior and only 
inflicts one unit of damage on either the player or the wall. The Warrior is slower and inflicts two units of data. There is a scoreboard
that keeps track of how many goblins the player kills.

Once the enemy gets behind the player they inflict their damage and disappear. The player moves on a fixed arc and must move to intercept
the enemy and kill them. 

The game is configured to run on a Windows PC.  

Controls: The space bar is used to swing the club.
Movement is done using the arrow keys, left arrow moving left, right arrow moving right. 

There are two versions of the game that were configured. One for Hard mode and one for easy mode. They were configured separately for 
the purposes of the study attached to the game.  By configuring them separately we could keep the subject from seeing which version they
were playing before they began.  

This game was created in a one and a half month period using Unity and coded in C#. 
Testing of the game was done by Eloy Perez, a friend and classmate. He would play the game, find the bugs and report them so I could
debug it. 
I created the goblin models and animations using Blender.  
The music and sound effects were found on sound-effects .org and created using effects uploaded with open licenses.
